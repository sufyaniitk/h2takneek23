### Overview

I'm running low on time here so won't be descriptive. I have no idea what to do with the audio, frankly. I've tried binary maps and xor encryptions and whatnot, I'm very lost.

The image, however, led me down to searching for visual cryptography where I found **Hexahue** cipher. The image is directly that, and yields "KSHATRIYATAKNEEK" when deciphered. Don't know what to do with this.
