### Overview

#### Approach to Part 1

Seeing the problem, we started to work on small cases and immediately realised that $1$ bullet in $4$ chambers gives a probability of $50\%$. To see this, imagine a diamond shape with each vertex representing a bullet chamber. Color one of these red, representing the bullet. When the bullet chambers are spinned, there is equal probability of the "starting point" landing on any one of the vertices. The person will certainly die if it lands on the chamber before the bullet, or 2 behind the bullet. This is $2$ chambers out of $4$, hence $50 \%$.

Working our way forward, we realised that a lot of configurations reach close to $50\%$, ($2$, $3$ bullets in $8$ chambers, $6$ bullets in $21$ chambers, etc) but for the sake of this problem, we will be using $2$ bullets in $7$ chambers as the solution to the *second lowest* part of this problem.

**Final answer to part 1** $4$ is the lowest number of chambers, $7$ is the $2nd$ lowest

#### Approach to Part 2

This is overall a game with 2 possible end states, $0$ and $200$. We are given that a game ends for a given starting condition, and need to determine that the end state it reaches is the $200$ one.

$4$ bullets in $7$ chambers has an overall $1/7$ survival rate (averaged over all possible configurations since all of them are equally likely). We tried a recursion equation. Let $P_n$ be the probability of the end state being $200$ patients starting from $n$ patients. There's $1/7$ chance we reach $n+1$ from here, and $6/7$ that we reach $n-1$. Thus,

$$P_n = \frac{1}{7}P_{n+1} + \frac{6}{7}P_{n-1}$$

Solving this with roots to the characteristic polynomial $x^2 - 7x + 6 = 0$ we obtain the expression $P_n = \alpha(6^n) + \beta(1^n)$. Using the initial conditions $P_0 = 0$ and $P_{200} = 1$, we get $P_n = \dfrac{6^n-1}{6^{200}-1}$. Putting in $n = 100$ gives us the **final answer to part 2**,  which is $\dfrac{6^{100}-1}{6^{200}-1} = \dfrac{1}{1 + 6^{100}}$.


Note that the game allows starting states greater than $n = 200$. Indeed, the expression is invalid for $n > 200$. Regardless, since the game will end at $n = 200$ anyway, the game can *never* reach the $0$ end state, hence $P_m = 1 \forall m>100$
