Absolutely not straightforward due to limited functionality. Overall, we store a copy each of the current candidate for the minimum value, and one that we're currently checking. If the original value is minimum, it gets returned and we destroy the comparsion candidate. If it is not and the original gets destroyed, we have a copy of the new candidate and we can repeat the process.

Sankalp Mittal, Aryan Verma, and a special mention Lakshya Kumar Singh for staying with the problem from start to end. 

#### Closing note

The 4th problen is an implementation of the *min* function we effectively built in problem 2, however the process is tedious and tiresome therefore omitted keeping in mind the deadline.
