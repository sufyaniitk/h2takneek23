### Overview

We first realised that our functionalities with this language are very limited. However, the problems given do not require much to begin with. After brainstorming for a while, we were able to solve 3 out of 4 problems:

Absolutely not straightforward due to limited functionality. Overall, we store a copy each of the current candidate for the minimum value, and one that we're currently checking. If the original value is minimum, it gets returned and we destroy the comparsion candidate. If it is not and the original gets destroyed, we have a copy of the new candidate and we can repeat the process.

Absolutely not the cleanest implementation. Best part: it doesn't work. We have absolutely no idea how to debug this because of 10 instances of the same 30-something-line code block and thanks to Mr Sankalp Mittal for suggesting that we don't try implementing a loop. Anyway, we perform the following operations: take a number 'i' (starting from 9 and decrementing) and compare it with the whole string one by one. Whenver we get 'i' in the string, add it to a queue. This works because the number is made from digits 0-9 and the ascending string can be achieved by counting the number of 0s and appending them to a string, then counting the number of 1s, etc.

#### Credits for solving the problems

Mohd Sufyan, Sankalp Mittal, Aryan Verma, and a special mention Lakshya Kumar Singh for staying with the problem from start to end. 

#### Closing note

The 4th problen is an implementation of the *min* function we effectively built in problem 2, however the process is tedious and tiresome. Both implementing a for loop and copying the code blocks are very effort heavy, however the main idea has been presented.
