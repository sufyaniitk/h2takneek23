### PS2 (Astronomy)

On seeing the definition of  *conjunction* of two celestial bodies, the problem solving approach was as follows:

For a conjunction to occur, Earth,  Jupiter, and Saturn must be in a line and in the said order exactly.  Thus, the sum of distances from Earth to Jupiter and Jupiter to Saturn must be equal to Distance of Earth to Saturn.

#### Approach

Assumptions taken in simplifying the model:

- The orbits of all three planets are assumed to be in a single plane.
- All 3 planets and the sun are colinear on Decebmer 2020's conjunction

The approach to solve the problem was as follows:

The orbital equations can be represented parametrically with the parameter $t$ (time in years since December 2020). Each orbital equation is of the polar form 
$$ r=\frac{a(1-e^2)}{1+e *cos(\theta)}$$


where $a$ is the semimajor axis and $e$ is the eccentricity of the orbit.

Then, for each planet we use the data available to write their equations parametrically, using $\theta = \omega_{planet} *t$

Finally we define the 3 lengths $l_{12},l_{13},l_{31}$ to be the distances between Earth and Jupiter, Jupiter and Saturn, Saturn and Earth respectively.
On aplying the condition $l_{12}+l_{13}-l_{31}=0$ , we get the values of $t$ for which conjunction occurs.

The three equations of orbits come out to be:

$$r = 149 \cdot \frac{1 - e_1^2}{1 + e_1cos(2\pi t)}$$
$$r = 778 \cdot \frac{1 - e_2^2}{1 + e_2cos(\frac{\pi}{6}t)}$$
$$r = 1432 \cdot \frac{1 - e_3^2}{1 + e_3cos(\frac{2\pi}{29.4}t)}$$

for Earth, Jupiter, and Saturn respectively. Their eccentricities are $e_1 = 0.167, e_2=0.0484, e_3=0.0541$ respectively.

To get $l_{12},l_{13},l_{31}$, we convert from polar to Cartesian and apply distance formula. Finally, we plot $l_{12}+l_{13}-l_{31}$ versus $t$ and see where the plot hits $0$. We cannot directly plot the zeroes due to floating point imprecision.

#### Answers to questions

1. The maximum number of conjunctions of these planets which can occur in $365$ consecutive days is $3$.

1. Assuming that the first triple conjunction occured in $2020$, by the grouping of roots we get that the next triple conjunction would happen in $2121 - 2122$ as the conjunctions occur almost periodically with a period of 20 years and the **triple conjunctions seem to happen roughly once every century.**

1. We were unable to determine with certainty the constellation in which the triple conjunctions would appear.
